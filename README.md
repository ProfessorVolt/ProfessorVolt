- 👋 Hi, I’m @ProfessorVolt
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, automating all sorts of "things" with the mission "TO MAKE OUR LIVES EASIER!", hacking, reverse engineering, etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning linux (kali), python, javascript, C#, networking;
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects especially if their hack-related
- OFC, as I want to apply as an PEN-TESTER all hacking activities practised by me are ONLY on my own servers/resources or on ppl that are aware, have allowed me and I`m in NO WAY breaking the law!
- 📫 How to reach me ... punkinfocode@gmail.com
